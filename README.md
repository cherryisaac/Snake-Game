My SnakeGamer - Freelance Java Project
by Isaac Cherry

The goal of the user:
- To collect as many apples as possible

Functionality:
- The arrows control the snake
- The space bar pauses the game
- The apple will appear randomly each time the snake eats it
- The snake grows longer as it eats more apples
- There is a scoreboard at the top that lets you know how many apples you've collected in total so far
- When the snake goes out of bounds or runs into itself game over text will be shown to the user

Bugs:
- Sometimes the snake can go out of bounds with no game over function triggered

Future features I would like to implement:
- A high score tracker to keep track of the highest score so far or of the top 5 highest scores made for each mode
- A basic pause menu feature to select the choices of resume, restart and exit game
- Select difficulty between Easy, Medium, and Hard
- With easy mode the snake can go out of bounds and spawns on the opposite side, but can still fail if it runs into it's self
- With medium mode the user can lose if the snake goes out of bounds, or it runs into itself
- With hard mode I would like the same as medium, but with a few obstacles that have to be avoided
- Time attack mode where the snake collects as many apples in a given time frame (5 or 10 min)
